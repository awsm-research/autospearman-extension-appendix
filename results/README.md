# Supplementary Experimental Results

We present subsets of metrics that are produced by 10 studied feature selection techniques and our own contribution, **AutoSpearman**, for all studied defect datasets.
A true value indicates that a metric is selected, while a fale value indicates that a metric is removed.
We describe the abbreviation for each file below.

1. CFS - Correlation-based Feature Selection Technique
2. IG - Information Gain Feature Selection Technique
3. Chisq - Chi-Squared-based Feature Selection Technique
4. CON - Consistency-based Feature Selection Technique
5. findCorrelation - findCorrelation feature selection technique (caret implementation)
6. RFE-LR - Recursive Feature Elimination Technique (Logistic Regression)
7. RFE-RF - Recursive Feature Elimination Technique (Random Forest)
8. Step-FWD - Stepwise Regression (Forward Direction)
9. Step-BWD - Stepwise Regression (Backward Direction)
10. Step-Both - Stepwise Regression (Both Directions)
11. **AutoSpearman** - An automated metric selection approach based on correlation analyses for statistical inference.
